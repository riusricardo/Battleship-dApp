The Battleship dApp is a decentralized game. The application uses Ethereum Whisper as its principal communication layer. Each move has a nonce and is signed by the player enabling a fast and fluid game without the need to wait mined blocks. The identities and signers are managed on the EthrDID Registry.

You can play against anyone in the other side of the world and even bet on the final outcome without compromising your location.
